        <p style="color: aqua;">Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).So,  if a person learns C programming first, it will help him to learn any modern programming language as well. As learning C help to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system. Like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.After the above discussion, we can formally assess the structure of a C program. By structure, it is meant that any program can be written in this structure only. Writing a C program in any other structure will hence lead to a Compilation Error.Operating systems: C is widely used for developing operating systems such as Unix, Linux, and Windows.
        Embedded systems: C is a popular language for developing embedded systems such as microcontrollers, microprocessors, and other electronic devices.System software: C is used for developing system software such as device drivers, compilers, and assemblers.Networking: C is widely used for developing networking applications such as web servers, network protocols, and network drivers.Database systems: C is used for developing database systems such as Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.Gaming: C is often used for developing computer games due to its ability to handle low-level hardware interactions.
        Artificial Intelligence: C is used for developing artificial intelligence and machine learning applications such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms.Scientific applications: C is used for developing scientific applications such as simulation software and numerical analysis tools.Financial applications: C is used for developing financial applications such as stock market analysis and trading systems.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or if you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.</p>

        <li id="HTML" style="color:  blueviolet;">HTML</li>
        <p style="color: aqua;">HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.yperText Markup Language is the computer language that facilitates website creation. The language, which has code words and syntax just like any other language, is relatively easy to comprehend and, as time goes on, increasingly powerful in what it allows someone to create. HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands and requirements of the Internet under the guise of the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization that designs and maintains the language; for instance, with the transition to Web 2.0.HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. By clicking on special text called hyperlinks, users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the Internet simply by clicking on the available links. Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside of them; they mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in the form of boldface or italicized type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.At its core, HTML is a series of short codes typed into a text-file. These are the tags that power HTML’s capabilities. The text is saved as an HTML file and viewed through a web browser. The browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, as directed by the codes the author used to write what becomes the visible rendering. Writing HTML requires tags to be used correctly to create the author’s vision.The tags are what separate normal text from HTML code. Tags are the words between what are known as angle-brackets, which allow graphics, images, and tables to appear on the webpage. Different tags perform different functions. The most basic tags apply formatting to text. As web interfaces need to become more dynamic, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript applications may be used. CSS makes web pages more accessible and JavaScript adds power to basic HTML.</p>

        <p style="color: aqua;">Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out,what background images or colors are used, as well as a variety of other effects.CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides a powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a
        specification has been discussed and officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a recommendation.These ratified specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control over the actual implementation of the language. Independent companies and organizations create that software.Cascading Style Sheets level 1 (CSS1) came out of W3C as a recommendation in December1996. This version describes the CSS language as well as a simple visual formatting model for all the HTML tags.CSS2 became a W3C recommendation in May 1998 and builds on CSS1. This version adds
        support for media-specific style sheets e.g. printers and aural devices downloadable fonts,element positioning and tables.Many times, you may need to put additional comments in your style sheet blocks. So, it is very easy to comment any part in the style sheet. You can simply put your comments inside/.....this is a comment in style sheet...../.You can use /* ....*/ to comment multi-line blocks in similar way you do in C and C++
        programming languages.</p>

        <p style="color: aqua;">C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems. C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.C++ tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of C++. Our C++ tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It is an extension to C programming.Our C++ tutorial includes all topics of C++ such as first example, control statements, objects and classes, inheritance, constructor, destructor, this, static, polymorphism, abstraction, abstract class, interface, namespace, encapsulation, arrays, strings, exception handling, File IO, etc.C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded software engineers.C++ programming has been used in developing almost all the major Operating Systems like Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. Apart from the operating systems, the core part of many browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Chrome have been written using C++. C++ also has been used in developing the most popular database system called MySQL.C++ has been used extensively in developing new programming languages like C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, UNIX’s C Shell, PHP and Python, and Verilog etc.C++ is extremely fast which allows programmers to do procedural programming for CPU intensive functions and provides greater control over hardware, because of which it has been widely used in development of gaming engines.C++ is being heavily used in developing Medical and Engineering Applications like softwares for MRI machines, high-end CAD/CAM systems etc.

        <p style="color: aqua;">JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools. You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy a compiler.The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor.Let us take a sample example to print out "Hello World". We added an optional HTML comment that surrounds our JavaScript code. This is to save our code from a browser that does not support JavaScript. The comment ends with a "//-->". Here "//" signifies a comment in JavaScript, so we add that to prevent a browser from reading the end of the HTML comment as a piece of JavaScript code. Next, we call a function document.write which writes a string into our HTML document.JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines that appear in JavaScript programs. You can use spaces, tabs, and newlines freely in your program and you are free to format and indent your programs in a neat and consistent way that makes the code easy to read and understand.Simple statements in JavaScript are generally followed by a semicolon character, just as they are in C, C++, and Java. JavaScript, however, allows you to omit this semicolon if each of your statements are placed on a separate line. For example, the following code could be written without semicolons.JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that the language keywords, variables, function names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.</p>
